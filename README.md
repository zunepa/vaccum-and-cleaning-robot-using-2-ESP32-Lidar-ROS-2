DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF HOME CLEANING ROBOTS
ABSTRACT
This thesis presents the design and implementation of an autonomous vacuum and mopping robot that integrates Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology to achieve real-time navigation and efficient cleaning in indoor environments. The motivation behind this research stems from the limitations of conventional cleaning robots, which often rely on random movement or basic sensors, resulting in poor coverage and low adaptability to dynamic spaces.
The proposed system is built around a dual-microcontroller architecture using ESP32, enabling the separation of motor control and sensor data processing. The robot employs LiDAR to accurately scan and map its surroundings, while SLAM algorithms facilitate simultaneous localization and path planning. Additional sensors, including ultrasonic and infrared modules, are used to enhance obstacle detection and ensure safe operation in cluttered areas.
Key contributions of this work include a low-cost hardware design, an efficient integration of LiDAR-based SLAM into a cleaning robot platform, and the development of cleaning strategies that optimize coverage while minimizing redundancy. Experimental results in real home-like environments demonstrate the robot's ability to generate accurate maps, localize itself reliably, and clean effectively with minimal human intervention.
This project not only improves the current state of autonomous cleaning systems but also serves as a scalable foundation for future developments in smart home robotics and service automation.
